# API Testing Rules

All API endpoints MUST be covered by comprehensive tests before merging. The following requirements apply:

- All tests must be async and use `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.
- Each endpoint must have tests for:
  - Authentication (401, valid/invalid tokens)
  - Input validation (valid/invalid/missing data, type/format/length)
  - Business logic (success, edge, error, data integrity)
- GET endpoints must test data structure, status codes, 404s, query params, pagination, and response format.
- POST/PUT endpoints must test creation/update, response format, validation, duplicates, related resources, partial/full updates, and defaults.
- DELETE endpoints must test deletion, status codes, non-existent resources, and related cleanup.
- All tests must be self-contained, create their own data, and clean up after themselves.
- Tests must be documented and organized by feature/endpoint.
- No test data leaks between tests.
- All code paths, error conditions, and edge cases must be tested.
- Tests must pass in CI and meet minimum coverage (80%).
- Pull requests without complete, passing tests will be rejected.
