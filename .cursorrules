# Cursor Rules for API Development

## Testing Requirements

### New Endpoint Testing
- Every new API endpoint MUST have corresponding tests
- Tests must be created BEFORE the endpoint is merged
- Tests must cover all required scenarios (see TESTING_RULES.md)

### Test Structure
- All tests must be async with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
- Tests must be self-contained
- Each test must create its own test data
- Tests must clean up after themselves

### Required Test Categories
For each endpoint, the following must be tested:

#### Authentication
- Unauthorized access (401)
- Authorized access with valid token
- Authorized access with invalid token

#### Input Validation
- Valid input data
- Invalid input data (422)
- Missing required fields
- Invalid field types
- Field length/format validation

#### Business Logic
- Success case
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Data integrity checks

### Endpoint-Specific Requirements

#### GET Endpoints
- Returns correct data structure
- Returns correct status code
- Handles non-existent resources (404)
- Handles query parameters
- Handles pagination (if applicable)

#### POST/PUT Endpoints
- Creates/updates resource successfully
- Returns correct response format
- Validates input data
- Handles duplicate data (if applicable)
- Updates related resources (if applicable)

#### DELETE Endpoints
- Deletes resource successfully
- Returns correct status code
- Handles non-existent resources
- Handles related resource cleanup

### Code Review Requirements
Before merging any endpoint:
1. All required test cases must be implemented
2. Tests must pass in isolation and together
3. No test data leaks between tests
4. Error cases must be properly handled
5. Edge cases must be covered
6. Database operations must be verified
7. Response formats must be validated
8. Authentication must be properly tested
9. Input validation must be comprehensive

### Enforcement
- Pull requests without tests will be rejected
- Incomplete test coverage will block merging
- Tests must pass all checks before merging
- All test requirements must be met before code review

### Documentation
- All tests must be documented
- Test documentation must explain the purpose of each test
- Complex test scenarios must include comments
- Test failures must be clearly documented

### Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass in CI environment
- Test coverage must meet minimum requirements
- No decrease in test coverage allowed
- All new code must be covered by tests
